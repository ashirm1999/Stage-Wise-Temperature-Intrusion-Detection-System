# Stage-Wise-Temperature-Intrusion-Detection-System

The IoT is a pretty simple concept, it means taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet.

So the idea behind my project is to determine whether the anomaly was due to human error or due to any intruder trying to access it. I have created a temperature tracking system for the refrigerator along with the stage-wise anomaly detection.

In stage 1 if the door of the refrigerator is not closed properly or it is left open then the buzzer will ring at low frequency and we will be alerted via Mail saying that the Door is open, close it. In stage 2 if the door is opened by an intruder than the buzzer will ring at high frequency for a longer period of time and we will be alerted via SMS that someone has opened the door also the time is displayed when the anomaly was detected.

Real-life implementation can be seen in the pharmacy sector or any sector involving COLD storage.
